Powers RK, ElBasiouny SM, Rymer WZ and Heckman CJ. Contributions of
intrinsic properties and synaptic inputs to motoneuron discharge
patterns: a simulation study.  J Neurophys, 107:808-823, 2012.

These files were contributed by Randy Powers.

Usage: This archive contains all the files necessary to produce the
responses of a medium threshold motoneuron to the triangular
current-clamp, voltage-clamp and noisy conductance commands used in
Powers et al. 2012.  These simulations use and require that NEURON
(<a href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu">http://www.neuron.yale.edu</a>)
is installed. The base code and mod files are in the subfolder "code".
The files for initiating the simulations and for specifying the
parameters for a medium threshold motoneuron are in the subfolder
"MN_hoc_and_output".

Either auto-launch from ModelDB or compile the mod files in the code
folder with mknrndll (MacOS and mswin) or by typing "nrnivmodl code"
(unix/linux).  You can start the simulation by with either the
mosinit.hoc file, init_synss.hoc, or init_gramp.hoc.  The former
allows you to select either of the latter by clicking a button.  The
file init_synss.hoc is used for current-clamp and voltage-clamp
simulations, whereas init_gramp.hoc is used for the simulating
responses to synaptic conductance commands.


Upon running init_synss.hoc, the NEURON Main Menu and a window
entitled "FR motoneuron control panel" will appear.  Click the pick a
file button and pick Medium_thresh_MN.hoc. Then click Exit on the file
chooser. Then click the "Choose analysis" button and pick either FI
for the current-clamp simulation or IV for the voltage-clamp
simulation.  If you click "GO" the "IV" simulation will generate
Fig. 1E:

and Fig. 1F:

After the simulation is finished an output text file is
generated that either lists injected current and spike time values
(for current-clamp) or voltage command and voltage-clamp current
values (for voltage clamp).  For the voltage-clamp simulation you have
the option of looking at the effects of tonic excitatory input, by
clicking the enable synaptic input button.

Upon running init_gramp.hoc you can record the responses to the
various mixtures of excitatory and inhibitory input used in Powers et
al. 2012 by executing the commands in the file gramp_commands.
